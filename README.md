## ✨ Why LockedIn?

- **970 million** people worldwide live with anxiety or depression (WHO 2023).  
- During stressful periods people abandon complex apps; therapists instead advise: *“Lock in the basics.”*  
- Existing wellness tools are cloud-heavy and privacy-risky—often unusable in low-connectivity regions.

**LockedIn** brings five evidence-backed daily habits to the palm of your hand and keeps working with *zero* internet.  
Gemma 3n runs locally to deliver empathetic coaching, crisis detection and personalized insights—no data ever leaves the device.
